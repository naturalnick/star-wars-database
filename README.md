## Summary

Features:

-  A search bar that uses the API's search functionality to find characters by name. The search bar actively searches while typing.

-  Mobile-friendly view hides pagination and allows table scrolling

What I learned:<br>

-  This project helped me get to know a lot more about React Hooks and their different uses
-  How to use aysnc and await to get api data appropriately
-  How to utilise multiple states to keep the app's renders minimal and maintain efficiency
